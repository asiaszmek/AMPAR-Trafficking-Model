# AMPAR-Trafficking-Model

AMPAR-Trafficking-Model contains the Python code used in the paper "The biophysical basis underlying the maintenance of early phase long-term potentiation". 

* Two types of models are provided, a stochastic and mean-field model.
* You find two modules mf.py (mean-field) and sm.py (stochastic model) containing classes and functions for the two models. The python module FRAP contains a function to carry out a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) simulation.
* The folders "Mean-Field-Model" and "Stochastic-Model" further contain python scripts to reproduce the figures shown in the paper. Each script is named after the figures as they appear in the Paper.
* Documentation of the modules is provided under Mean-Field-Model\docs\build\index.html and Stochastic-Model\docs\build\index.html respectively.
